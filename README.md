Fractional Real Estate Ownership on Bitcoin via Stacks

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Realvora is a decentralized platform enabling anyone to invest in global real estate  *fractionalized property NFTs*.  
Users can mint NFTs, track returns, participate in DAO governance, and trade NFTs in a transparent, borderless way.

This submission demonstrates the platform's *wallet connection, NFT minting, dummy KYC workflow, and live property analytics*.

## 🧭 Problem Statement
Real estate investment is traditionally limited by:
- High capital entry requirements
- Complex legal and regulatory barriers
- Lack of liquidity and transparency

Millions of potential investors are excluded from the global real estate market.

- Tokenizing properties as NFTs on *Stacks*
- Allowing users to mint NFTs after completing KYC
- Providing a *dashboard* with live analytics and property performance tracking
- Enabling *DAO-based governance* for property-related decisions
- Planning a *secondary market* for NFT trading 
- also integration of defi lending so that users can borrow against their assets (NFTs)
